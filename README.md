# Features
1. Faculty component has states whose value can be changed using either axios or fetch with the support of an API.
2. Add button opens a pop up which will add another button in the Faculty Component. 
3. Scratch Pad uses React-Signature-Canvas and React-Popup and can be drawn in. 
4. React Spring was used in the header for the animation on reload. (The header comes down as well as its opacity increases)
5. The navbar contains the searchbar which as of now is a simple text field. 
6. The side bar has icons from FontAwesome alongside each button. The buttons have no functionality as of now because they have to be mapped to different websites, but all the buttons in the webpage are responsive, i.e., can be hovered over, change color on clicks, etc.

I was looking forward to add a video player using video-react.js but there seemed to be a problem with Prism (react-prism). However , I can do it in an extra hour or two. 

The left side bar, I planned on making it a hamburger menu at first(using CSS animation), however, it made the page look empty, so I decided against it. 

The use of states in the Main.js and AddSub.js will show my understanding of states, and I am pretty confident I can manipulate them.
